        <p>Can the designer equip the client with the tools to produce their own creative branding materials?

        <h4>Designers Who: offsite publishing, onsite commentary</h4>
        <p>Bonnie, Aimee, and The Brandling's Anne Miltenberg conceived and built Designers Who to share design articles and host the commentary that surrounds it. DW contains no imagery and no articles, instead treating reader comments as a form of design publishing. <a href="https://designerswho.com">View Project</a></p>

        <h4>Design As Activity: A Workshop in 4 Parts</h4>
        <p>A day-long intensive workshop that broke design practice into four pillars: writing, research, type and image making, and challenged students using unconventional processes to experiment within short timeframes. In conjunction with Paul Fuog (<a href="http://u-p.co">U-P.co</a>), Veronica Grow (<a href="http://newschoolfordesignandtypography.com/">Old School New School</a>) and Jack Musset (<a href="http://motherbird.com.au">Motherbird</a>).</p>

        <h4>Gather and Fold</h4>
        <p>Over 15 months, we interviewed 29 creatives local to Melbourne about their process, practice and community. The interviews ran on a referral basis, meaning that each interviewee chose who was interviewed next, ensuring there was no author-led curation. The connections between disciplines, ages and experience levels were exposed as organically as possible, acting as a snapshot cross-section of Melbourne's wider creative scene in 2011-2013. The project initially ran as a blog, and was published as a book in 2014.<br>

        <p>We have recently closed down the original web archive, but have made the book freely available <a href="http://double-days.com/gather.html">as a download</a>.</p>
