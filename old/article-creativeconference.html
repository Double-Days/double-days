					<p><b>The Creative Conference for the Real World</b></p>
					<p>The designer's habitual pursuit of inspiration is itself often rather uninspired and rarely quality controlled, with online resources providing endless distraction. Design conferences are therefore an excellent opportunity to break such habits, as concentrated exposure can be far more valuable. But attending such events has become less vital with the emergence of online conferences, such as TED Talks, and thorough bloggers breaking down particular events into audio highlights.</p>
					<p>Yet the pull of the real world prevails. Semi-Permanent, held annually in Sydney for nine years, now also stages conferences across Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, London, and Dubai. This year is its first in Berlin and it has built a reputation on presenting the new and the now. With a non-specific bill of creative speakers, both emerging and internationally recognised talents, and events running alongside, the experience is similar to a mini-festival; celebrating the idea of cross-pollination between disciplines, attracting mainly students and young professionals.</p>
					<p>But once inside, and with 12 speakers over two days, the conference is actually less like a party and more like hard work. This is to Semi-Permanent's credit. While the intentions of including emerging designers with smaller experience levels can add to the richness of the entire experience, when someone hasn't had the years to succeed and fail, they can often have little wisdom to share, and can flounder within the given expanse of an hour. That's not to say that there weren't real moments of honesty and ingenuity here.
					</p>
					<p>It was speakers like these - aware of excessive hard work for modest achievements - that succeeded in reaching the audience's level. Ken Taylor joked about his illustrated "hot ghosts" on gig posters with a self-deprecating smirk, and paper-engineer Benja Harney was genuinely chuffed at being asked to speak: "Just a few years ago I was in the audience!"</p>
					<p>Local artist Sam Leach was an unexpected source of the kind of inspiration I was looking for. The 2010 Archibald Prize winner, and controversial winner of the Wynn Art Prize, he had an earthy, cynical charisma. Years spent working in the Australian Tax Office before committing to art full time, his paintings can be decoded by their contrasted 17th century Dutch appropriation and corporate foyers. The symbolism is blunt, but telling of an analytical, logical adult. His ease of talking about his work with it's place in art's history without a moments grandeur, was something I have never known a contemporary designer able to do.</p>
					<p>And not so with Droga5. Their efforts to distinguish themselves as independent of the advertising world wound them tighter within the stereotype, with sharply edited videos of their campaigns backed with inspirational soundtracks. With strong undertones that their work was changing the world, they kept what would have been truly interesting - a breakdown of the realities of creating such campaigns as The Great Schlep - a myth.</p>
					<p>Kurppa Hosk chose a different approach. Beginning with a lengthy, charming introduction, Mans Jacobsson took a full 25 minutes to actually get round to showing slides of their work (backed by home-made techno). And The Entente, pointing out a spelling mistake on one of their slides, confessed "We deal with letters, but can't write". They showed the beauty of taking "the long way round", often having to design whole new typefaces for each job, before they are satisfied. "Client's expect a new font for every job now!". Anthony and Edd talked through their meticulous type and design work that, if seen without context, feels like unearthed pieces of print curios - their sincere use of typographic novelty, faded inks and retrograde sensibilities, but still so strikingly contemporary.</p>
					<p>
					Scott Dadich, VP of Digital Magazine Development at Cond&eacute; Nast and previous art director of WIRED, was one half of the main draw-card for this year's conference. He was experienced cool onstage, his talk sectioned into snappy maxims, "Good design is more than graphics", "Constraint is freedom", "When in doubt, beer", but it was the case studies using examples from WIRED that were the most memorable. His "Wrong Theory", which he expanded with "Design something beautiful, then ruin it", was Dadich, recognising his own pre-occupation for slick, simple layouts, teaching himself to design in a way that makes him uncomfortable, working against his own judgment. With engineered print errors and graphic elements that disturb balanced compositions, it is an anti-formula immediately recognisable in the magazine.</p>
					<p>Dadich has spoken at SP before, in 2009, and while quite discerning about his lecture circuit, had wanted to return. And this time, he suggested his friend and colleague Platon speak as well. Platon too exuded ease onstage that comes from lengthy practice, the confidence of great work, and natural charisma. His rehearsed anecdotes shared little about the inner workings of his process, but entertained with the inner workings of his subjects. With each portrait - Obama, Qaddafi, Berlusconi, came his humanist style of commentary - mostly humorous, but at times, as in his portraits of Burmese children, chilling.</p>
					<p>I have heard Semi-Permanent criticised for its tendency of recruiting speakers who gain a lot of contemporary hype. Murray Bell, one of the founders, explained that the speakers were chosen for relevance, not trendiness. "When I was in college, I didn't know where to go, what to do," he says. "Direction really helps, all kinds of direction... We want to include speakers who are relatable to people, closer to them, and also those that are aspirational". </p>
					<p>And what hesitations were initially felt at the contrasted experience and knowledge of the speakers, with reflection, cleared up - a conference that celebrates the modest achievements of the emerging, upon the same platform as the worship of industry giants, is successful as a healthy, fully-formed cross-section of the contemporary creative world.</p>
