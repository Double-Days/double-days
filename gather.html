					<h4>Gather and Fold</h4>
					<p>
						From 2011—2013, we interviewed 29 artists, designers, makers, photographers, illustrators and arcitects based in Melbourne. We published these interviews online as <i>Gather and Fold</i>. </p>
					<p>
						This content wasn't curated — instead, each interviewee chose who was to be interviewed next. They refered their friends, those they admired or collaborated with. Over time, this enabled the interviews to trace the natural connections that had form between disciplines, ages and experience levels: a cross-section of Melbourne's wider creative community.</p>

					<p>	The original web archive is no longer online, but the entire project was published as a book in 2013. All copies have now sold out, however you can download a free PDF version here (108 mb). <span class="text-highlight"><a href="https://github.com/Double-Days/double-days/releases/download/gather-and-fold/Gather.and.Fold.pdf">Download</a></span>
