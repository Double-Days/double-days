        <h2>Bonnie Abbott (AUS)</h2>
        <p>Designer, writer, researcher.</p>
        <p>Bonnie co-founded Double Days in 2011 as a way to explore the intersection between digital and print publishing, and soon after, to focus on experimental design projects that sought to challenge the traditional processes designers rely on.</p> 
        <p>Bonnie worked in publication design and wrote for <i>Creative Review, Process Journal, ArchitectureAU</i> and <i>MADE Journal</i>, before her role as editor at <i>Desktop Magazine</i>. She has co-published two books, <i>Semi-Precious</i> and <i>Gather and Fold</i>, and presented talks and sat upon panels at Analogie Digital, Melbourne Writers Festival, Vivid Sydney and Triple R.</p>
        <p>A move into the tech industry led her towards design strategy and research, particularly design ethnography. She currently lectures in design processes at RMIT University and Design Thinking at Monash University, runs professional development workshops, writes on design and conducts research for design and tech-based companies. </p>

        <h2>Aimee Jay (UK)</h2>
        <p>Interactive designer and researcher.</p>
        <p>Aimee's work is characterised by her interest in travel, community and communication. This combination led to her co-founding Double Days in 2011, co-publishing its design journal <i>Gather and Fold</i>, managing the design and build of online commentary platform <i>Designers Who...</i> and facilitating its latest project – the workshop series Design Infidelity.</p>
        <p>Originally from the UK, Aimee's interests have taken her all over the world. While her work began with interaction design, she moved towards design research in 2016. She is currently living and working in New Zealand, conducting design research and product management within the country's rich viticulture industry.</p>

        <p class="text-underline">Design Infidelity: Alternative Methods for Thinking and Acting</p>
        <p>A design workshop series of introspective tool-building and practical ideation methods. The aims is to augment existing design processes with skills and techniques used by non-design professionals, while acknowledging a designer's personal approaches and biases. The workshops have appeared at RMIT University, General Assembly Melbourne, Melbourne Design Week, and soon— Vivid Ideas. <br>

        <p class="text-underline">Resisting the styleguide: How a designer can empower a client to brand themselves.</p>
        <p>So often, small companies and individuals ask designers for a logo. Can the designer, instead, equip them with the tools to produce their own branded materials? In an ongoing project, we are exploring how to frame an appropriate space where a brand may be flexible yet allow the authentic production of material from its most invested stakeholder.</p>

      <div class="col-1-2">
        <h4>Designers Who: offsite publishing, onsite commentary</h4>
        <p>Online platform to share design articles and host the commentary that surrounds it. Contains no imagery and no articles, instead treating reader comments as a form of design publishing in themselves. The project ran for 2 seasons and is now closed, but all past discussion can still be viewed. <br>

        <h4>Design As Activity: A Workshop in 4 Parts</h4>
        <p>A day-long intensive workshop that broke design practice into four pillars: writing, research, type and image making, and challenged students using unconventional processes to experiment within short timeframes. In conjunction with Paul Fuog (<a href="http://u-p.co">U-P.co</a>), Veronica Grow (<a href="http://newschoolfordesignandtypography.com/">Old School New School</a>) and Jack Musset (<a href="http://motherbird.com.au">Motherbird</a>).</p>

        <h4>Gather and Fold: The Web Index</h4>
        <p>Over 15 months, we interviewed 29 creatives local to Melbourne about their process, practice and community. The interviews ran on a referral basis, meaning that each interviewee chose who was interviewed next, ensuring there was no author-led curation. The connections between disciplines, ages and experience levels were exposed as organically as possible, acting as a snapshot cross-section of Melbourne's wider creative scene in 2011-2013.<br>

       <h4>Gather and Fold: The Print Index</h4>
       <p>The Gather and Fold Web Index was published as a book in 2014, seeking to translate the web experience into print, retaining the same hyperlink, referential functionality.
