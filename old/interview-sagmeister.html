					<p><b>A Little Bit Scared.</b></p>
					<p style="padding-top:35px;"><i>As Stefan Sagmeister's <i>The Happy Film </i> nears release, graphic design's most notorious character offers some unlikely insights - into his recent work, his experiments with happiness, and his fears of stagnation.</i></p>
					<p style="padding-top:10px;">Stefan Sagmeister is surprisingly tall, his studio is very small. It is also neat, light, noisy and busy with a young, good-looking team's activities, politely pausing for my arrival, immediately refocusing on computer screens. Seated on the edge of the bustle, Sagmeister, well practiced in the art of receiving interview questions, answers graciously, then makes an unlikely confession: "I'm now 50. I'm a little bit scared," he admits, openly, his impervious Austrian accent lilting his speech, "There is a history of designers becoming tired of design in their 50's and turning into terrible artists."</p>
					<p style="padding-top:10px;">It's a significant statement coming from a graphic designer known for challenging and moderately shocking work, with a unique dedication to the use - and abuse - of his own body. Famous for carving the details of an AIGA meeting into his chest 2 decades ago, this physical commitment has seen him dangling from the Empire State Building, swimming across the Hudson, posing naked with his young (and equally naked) partner Jessica Walsh, and most recently, rigorously experimenting on his own mental health for his upcoming documentary <i>The Happy Film</i>. Such projects have bestowed a fame often at odds with the goodwill of his work, (a memorable project had him plastering New York City in posters, campaigning for women to be nice to his friend Reini), delivering a shock beneficial for promotion, but often taking on a notoriety outside the typical parameters of graphic design - a notoriety, he insists, that makes him uncomfortable. "That cutting poster," he said earnestly, eyebrows raised, "was meeting my heroes before I was".</p>
					<p style="padding-top:10px;">Themes of sex and physicality, happiness and self-improvement have been explored in his work for twenty years. Long has his audience known how Sagmeister looks when stripped. Through typographic maxims, Sagmeister has urged "Looking good limits my life," while placing a hive of bees on his naked chest. These themes, seemingly contrary, have coalesced in <i>The Happy Film</i>, his first documentary film, and its exhibited variant <i>The Happy Show</i>, currently at LACMA (he insists it "isn't art,"). Seeking insights into how to be happy and stay that way, such a leap into film is presumably a leap for a practicing graphic designer, and certainly there have been challenges: "My previous visual experience is much less help than what I thought," he admits, an unembarrassed confession, his tone sitting just below the studio din, "I thought I could switch easily to filmmaking, but it is sadly not the truth. All those designers that say they are storytellers? They are all fuckheads." He lacks malice, but not conviction - he speaks like he enjoys making destabilising discoveries: "Designers don't know anything about storytelling."</p>
					<p style="padding-top:10px;">Indeed such a shift in discipline is potentially injurious to professional confidence - currently in the editing process, he believes the film could still "turn out terribly". Sagmeister appears stuck in a conflict between boredom (reinvention is "boring") and fear of obsoletion. Here, beyond the fear of the atrophy of his young body, (his long term creative tool), is of his creative stagnation (his young mind). He leans forward in his chair, techno playing loudly in the background: "Who is 60 and doing significant work that they weren't doing earlier? I can already feel my brain going soft. Ideas are more difficult to come by."</p>
					<p style="padding-top:10px;">Documenting the effects of therapy, meditation and drugs on his levels of happiness, the experiments Sagmeister conducted upon himself for <i>The Happy Film</i> are yet another physical investigation for the designer, yet they are also the culmination of years of analysis and inquiry of deep personal significance. He reports he has come to some small "but significant" conclusions: happiness can be achieved through practice and forming habits. He will probably return to prescription drugs, "Surprisingly they seemed to have made the most difference", although temporarily. He recalls the short-lived contentment he found riding his scooter in Bali, "A great landscape, no helmet law, ten new songs, and no purpose. It would work every single time, " he smiled, his arms folded behind his head, a youthful posture in an otherwise youthful studio, "I would have shivers going down my spine."</p>

						<p style="padding-top:32px;"><i>The Print Index 2012&mdash;2013</br>
						Gather &amp; Fold, Melbourne</i></p>
						<p>Double Day's online journal, <i>Gather &amp; Fold</i>, has been put to print! This was a project completed in dedication to the local creative community, here to mark our contemporary history, a cross-section of our connections, friendships and mutual admirations. It is a wonderful feeling to hold in our hands the result of so many months of work. After all, there's nothing quite like print. </p>
						<p>Produced in a limited run of 400, with 24 contributors, the book features a lengthy "Tumblr" foldout, 120 pages of interviews and a cover produced with Xavier Connelly of Dawn Press.</p>
