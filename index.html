        <p class="text-underline">Design Infidelity: Alternative Methods for Thinking and Acting</p>
        <p>A design workshop series of introspective tool-building and practical ideation methods. The aims is to augment existing design processes with skills and techniques used by non-design professionals, while acknowledging a designer's personal approaches and biases. The workshops have appeared at RMIT University, General Assembly Melbourne, Melbourne Design Week, and soonâ€” Vivid Ideas. <br>

        <p class="text-underline">Resisting the styleguide: How a designer can empower a client to brand themselves.</p>
        <p>So often, small companies and individuals ask designers for a logo. Can the designer, instead, equip them with the tools to produce their own branded materials? In an ongoing project, we are exploring how to frame an appropriate space where a brand may be flexible yet allow the authentic production of material from its most invested stakeholder.</p>

        <h4>Designers Who: offsite publishing, onsite commentary</h4>
        <p>Online platform to share design articles and host the commentary that surrounds it. Contains no imagery and no articles, instead treating reader comments as a form of design publishing in themselves. The project ran for 2 seasons and is now closed, but all past discussion can still be viewed. <br>

        <h4>Design As Activity: A Workshop in 4 Parts</h4>
        <p>A day-long intensive workshop that broke design practice into four pillars: writing, research, type and image making, and challenged students using unconventional processes to experiment within short timeframes. In conjunction with Paul Fuog (<a href="http://u-p.co">U-P.co</a>), Veronica Grow (<a href="http://newschoolfordesignandtypography.com/">Old School New School</a>) and Jack Musset (<a href="http://motherbird.com.au">Motherbird</a>).</p>

        <h4>Gather and Fold: The Web Index</h4>
        <p>Over 15 months, we interviewed 29 creatives local to Melbourne about their process, practice and community. The interviews ran on a referral basis, meaning that each interviewee chose who was interviewed next, ensuring there was no author-led curation. The connections between disciplines, ages and experience levels were exposed as organically as possible, acting as a snapshot cross-section of Melbourne's wider creative scene in 2011-2013.<br>

       <h4>Gather and Fold: The Print Index</h4>
       <p>The Gather and Fold Web Index was published as a book in 2014, seeking to translate the web experience into print, retaining the same hyperlink, referential functionality.
