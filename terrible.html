					<p>Having built her experience in web, animation and motion graphics, Aimee's skills in interactive design was always characterised by her interest in community, communication and social good. Co-founding Double Days in 2011, Aimee's work with Gather &amp; Fold and Designers Who were built to challenge digital norms and notions of online publishing.

					<p>Bonnie Abbott (AUS)</p>
					<p>With a background in publication design, Bonnie's interest shifted to the designer-as-author model in 2011, writing with publications such as MADE Quarterly, Process Journal and Creative Review, and leading to the formation of Double Days and its experimental publishing projects.</p>
					<p>Bonnie worked as role of editor at Australia's oldest design publication Desktop from 2013&mdash;2015, and has presented talks and workshops on self-publishing, adaptive design processes, and content-driven design. She wrote and taught RMIT's 'Design Inï¬delity' studio in 2015, and currently works as Creative Lead at In Common.</p>

					<p>Resisting the styleguide: How can we empower clients to produce their own branded material?</p>
					<p>Bonnie is working on a model that would see the designer work as a facilitator, providing the tools that enable clients to produce their own creative branding material. In an appropriate space where a brands maybe fluid, the inquiry proposes that continuous, authentic production of material can only come from an equipped stakeholder. </p>

				<p>Past Projects</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><u>Designers Who: offsite publishing, onsite commentary</u></br>
				Bonnie, Aimee, and The Brandling's Anne Miltenberg conceived and built Designers Who to share design articles and host the commentary that surrounds it. DW contains no imagery and no articles, instead treating reader comments as a form of design publishing. <a href="https://designerswho.com/"target="_blank">VIEW PROJECT</a> <i class="fa fa-angle-right" style="font-size:12px"></i></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><u>Design Futures Lab: Public lecture programme and promotion</u></br>
				Bonnie curated the weekly public talks delivered through RMIT's DFL. Seeking to deconstruct podium-to-audience delivery, and challenge the tradition of 'thumbnail jpeg' promotion, speakers were invited to experiment with their lectures, and the lecture themes were used to inform the material and construction of the promotional posters.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><u>Design As Activity: A Workshop in 4 Parts</u></br>
				A day-long intensive workshop broke design practice into four pillars: writing, research, type and image making, and challenged students using unconventional processes to experiment within short timeframes. In conjunction with Paul Fuog (U-P.co), Veronica Grow (Old School New School) and Jack Musset (Motherbird).</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><u>#Platform Project with Mimi Zeigler and Neil Donnelly</u></br>
				As part of the D-Crit Summer Intensive, design writer attendees, contributed 140-character critiques of their work and their environment. After two weeks, these mini-critiques were published through public display.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><u>Gather and Fold: The Print Index</u></br>
				At the completion of the web-based publishing project, Gather and Fold was translated into a book. By interrogating its online origins, the publication's design and layout was informed by digital materials and approaches, affecting how the content was consumed, and leading to inclusions like printed "tumblr" scrolling. <font color="#003AC3"><strike>BUY A COPY</strike> SOLD OUT</font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><u>Gather and Fold: The Web Index</u></br>
				Over 15 months, 29 creatives local to Melbourne were interviewed about their process, practice and community. The interviews ran on a referral basis, meaning that each interviewee chose who was interviewed next, ensuring there was no author-led curation, and that the connections between disciplines, ages and experience levels were exposed as organically as possible. Now existing as an archive, the interviews act as a collective cross-section into the wider creative scene in Melbourne, as a snapshot in 2011-2013. <a href="https://designerswho.com/"target="_blank">VIEW ARCHIVE</a> <i class="fa fa-angle-right" style="font-size:12px"></i></p>
