					<h4>Gather and Fold: The Print Index</h4>
					<p>
						At the completion of the web-based publishing project, Gather and Fold was translated into a book. By interrogating its online origins, the publication's design and layout was informed by digital materials and approaches, affecting how the content was consumed, and leading to features like printed "tumblr" scrolling.

					<h4>Gather and Fold: The Web Index</h4>
					<p>
						Over 15 months, 29 creatives local to Melbourne were interviewed about their process, practice and community. The interviews ran on a referral basis, meaning that each interviewee chose who was interviewed next, ensuring there was no author-led curation. The connections between disciplines, ages and experience levels were exposed as organically as possible, acting as a snapshot cross-section of Melbourne's wider creative scene in 2011-2013.
